# TODO

-   [ ] Utilities to forward ports via ssh
-   [ ] Grid run utilities via CLI
-   [ ] More template adapters and generate them via CLI
    -   Specifically something that can track STDOUT and log metrics from STDOUT?
-   [ ] Cleaner source file and other meta info tracking
-   [ ] General utilities with `incense` -- maybe build `streamlit` app separately?
